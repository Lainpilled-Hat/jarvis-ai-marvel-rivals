Simple python tool using speech recognition from google, pyttx3, pynput to simulate talking to jarvis while playing marvel rivals.

This is inspired by Patchi's video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQFnD5ddRFc), where he makes an implementation with two arduinos, but I'm trying to make the 
same program work in open source and without arduinos.
